## About Us
Monster EOS is an experimental project based on the EOS main net. Administered by founder Leo Ribeiro and co-founder John Williamson

The project is an MIT licensed, open sourced project in which ideas and contributions are encouraged by the EOS community.
The dApp offers a donation system in which users of the dApp can donate to its development, these donations are entirely one way and do not offer any promise of any kind nor any kind of asset. Further info available on About Page. 

## Contributing to the project
We welcome anyone to bring forward ideas and pull requests to the project, before making any pull request please read the Ricardian contract to get more familiar. 
Please also confirm you understand notes set out especially about the EOSIO_ABI macro, create an issue should you fail to understand.

This project is still experimental and us developers are learning, we like to think this is a great contract to learn to better understand smart contract development. 

## Contribution incentives to committed/registered developers
The Monster EOS project offers dividends to committed developers which contribute to the project from the donation fund. 

To become a registered developer, one must apply to the MonsterEOS administrators and go through an application process, should they be successful they will be allocated a weight against their time, tasks to do and hours to do them in. 

Each month their hours recorded will be calculated and the developer will receive a dividend of the donation pool proportional to all developers contributions. 

### Example
#### Time Weights
- Developer A - 0.8
- Developer B - 1
- Developer C - 1

#### Hours
Developers work on various tasks throughout the month within their set hour limits, at the end of the month.
- Developer A works 15 hours
- Developer B works 10 hours
- Developer C works 5.5 hours. 

### Total Pay
- Developer A - 15 * 0.8 = 12  
- Developer B - 10 * 1 = 10
- Developer C - 5.5 * 1 = 5.5

Total weighted hours = 12 + 10 + 5.5 = 27.5

Shares for the month 
- Developer A = 43%
- Developer B = 36%
- Developer C = 21%
              100%

Finally, if 40 EOS were donated during the month, then.
- Developer A = 0.43 * 40 = 17.20 EOS Awarded
- Developer B = 0.36 * 40 = 14.40 EOS Awarded
- Developer B = 0.21 * 40 = 8.40 EOS Awarded

### Dividend amount
The amount of EOS distributed in the dividend is decided by management, in some cases, not all the month's donations will be used in order to save for any rainy days or other investments for the project.

### Conditions
- Only approved developers known as 'registered' will be awarded. 
- Registered developers are selected purely by MonsterEOS management. 
- Registered developers are renewed or cancelled each month according to MonsterEOS management.
- Only approved hours from the allocated budget are able to contribute to dividend amount. E.g. Cannot be given a budget of 10 hours and spend 60 expecting 60 hours to be awarded to you end of month. 
- Time spent is to be recorded on the GitHub pages Issue's tab under the 'registered' tag. Every hour declared must be accompanied with detailed information describing the nature of the work, describing any challenges, etc, warranting the time spent. E.g. Cannot put in time entry "I did stuff." 6 hours. Every minute spent must be honest. 
- This scheme is entirely without guarantee or warranty and may be cancelled at any time without any form of reimbursement for pending or previous work. Rules or conditions can be created, revoked at any time without explanation. 
- The MonsterEOS project ownership remains with the MonsterEOS founders. 

## Getting work
Tasks are to be created on the GitHub issues page, they can either be created by management or the developers themselves. 
An example could be a new issue created by a registered developer. 

### Example
#### "update the Ricardian contract to include new action" 
- "We should update the contract to reflect X change, I'd like to do this with a budget of 0.5 hours" - Developer A 
- "Great idea! Go ahead!, Appro
ved." - Management
- "All done, I did this in 0.5 hours" - Developer A 
The issue is marked as complete and tagged accordingly.
