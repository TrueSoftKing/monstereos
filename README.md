## About

I'm Leo and I built this project just as an experiment to play with EOS Testnets available in the community. I have a lot of questions about the EOS RAM Storage, Network Bandwith and Staking in a live chain (also in sidechains), and probably a lot of other developers also have it as I can see in the community. So this is an open source experiment where all of us can play with the contract, architecture and design of tables and see what works the best in terms of performance and good practices.

It's Just a Tamagotchi Game to show off EOS blockchain power, even in a TestNet! :D
To keep your pet alive you must feed him, play with him, take him to the bed and wash him!

Only the feeding and sleeping/awake feature is done for now... There's a lot of interesting stuff that we can do here to improve the project like experience points (+ age and evolutions), inventory of items, multiplayer options, breeding, ownership transferring and tokenization.

I would love to have another developers to get in touch in GitHub repository, open issues, open discussions and so on, about what would be the best way to design the architecture and implement the contracts, how things should work in blockchain, how we should integrate Scatter, other wallets and provide top-security, what we should avoid, what's the best practice in terms of coding and everything else.

I love EOS Community and I think we can build a better world together!
